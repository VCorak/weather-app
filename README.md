# The weather application

## Practical Information

* Repository: `ajax-weather-api`
* Deadline: 2 days
* Delivery: Github page (published)
* Team: Solo

## Learning Objectives

* A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results;
* DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on results of AJAX-requests.
* Learn to aggregate data fetched from an api
* First I was using axios and got totaly lost, deleted whole script and went again. I used await fetch method and finnaly made it to console.log api data and display it.Really learned a lot with try and error, but al least fetching forecast and images were easyer because I used the same method.
* Displaying the data was a quite of challenge bacause I had to use for loop to in forecast api to fetch the 5 days weather. It was a lot of struggling and I have to practice this more. Used the same method to get random city images from Unsplash, it worked but it was challenging again.
* CSS styling went smooth but could get better, not very satisfied with result.


CONCLUSION

I relly have to work on my time management, it took me two days to make this app work. When I get stuck on some problem I relly get stuck until I can figure it out and this takes somethimes a lot of time, pretty much opsseed with details and everything to work. And then I don't have time for CSS and just do basic stuff...
